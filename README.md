# CandidateMatchAlgo

This is prepared for Candidate Matching Algorithm - architecture challenge for TopCoder

There are two folders under this project, which represents two executables:

1. candidate_matching: it parses the raw text data of job requsition and talent profiles into features, and uses a baseline algorithm to produce a ranking with scores.

2. gbdt: this is Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm for "learning to rank", where it can automate the ranking process with machine learning instead of human-input weighing factors.

Please find the input/output/usage within each folder. The raw data input for candidate_matching is not here (but given in the challenge).
